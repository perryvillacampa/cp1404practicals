## Introduction and Repository 

This repository holds my work for CP1404 Programming II Module at James Cook University

My name is Villacampa Perry Kyle Pepito and I am currently studying Marine Science based in Townsville.

## Lessons learned about clean code

These are the main lessons I have learned about writing clean code throughout this subject.
1. Meaningful naming - Variables, functions, and classes should be named descriptively (e.g, calculate_area instead of ca).
    Names should be pronounceable and easily searchable. 
2. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Functions and methods should be small and focused, doing only one thing. This 
    makes code easier to test, debug and maintain.     
3. Consistent Formatting and Style - Following a standardised style guide or method for certain loops for example a 
    a standardised error checking loop.
