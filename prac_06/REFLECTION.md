# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
Some changes in my process such as prioritising and putting some effort into making test codes in order to ensure that 
my code is working perfectly fine. Especially when I had to develop new class methods in the guitar.py exercise. It also 
helps me to minimise my debugging time later on by isolating the errors. 


## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?
I need to spend more time on planning on paper before coding, especially for client applications where there were complex
string formatting and logic involved.


## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I am doing well at implementing the things that I have learnt from the lecture videos thus far. I should ensure that I 
always keep up with the weekly lecture videos before starting the practical exercises so that I have a clear idea of my 
strengths and weaknesses in coding.


## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I need to stop relying on immediate print statements for quick checks and transition fully into writing dedicated testing 
functions


## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
I do wish for more real world applications with the subject so that it will continue to pique my interest throughout my 
coding journey.
